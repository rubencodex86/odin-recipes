The Odin Project 1st Project: Recipes.

This is the first TOP project.
The objective it's to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have aquired so far, building a basic recipe website.

With this project I was able to practice how to:

- Create a github repo and clone it for my computer;
- Practice some terminal commands: like create dirs and files;
- I was able to review the "usual boilerplate" and use tags and elements;
- Practice git commands: git add / commit / push / status / log;
- Write links. Relative links;
- Practice heading sizes and paragraphs;
- Review unordered and ordered lists;
- Practice page structures;
- Put links in an unordered list;
- Work with multiple pages;
- Publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions about any part of the code.

Good luck!
